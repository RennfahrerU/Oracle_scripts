# Oracle_scripts

This repository shows **Oracle DB 23ai** and **PL/SQL** scripts made for the Oracle university course.


For most of the exercises the [HR schema](https://github.com/oracle-samples/db-sample-schemas) provided by Oracle is used.

It is recommended to use Oracle SQL Developer to develop them.
